The Congress finds that-- (1) cohort default rates alone do not indicate the quality of an educational institution; (2) for the purpose of evaluating performance of an institution of higher education, the population which that institution serves should be taken into account; (3) schools whose students are from less affluent backgrounds have more difficulty with cohort default rate standards; (4) use of the cohort default rates as a determinant for participation in Federal student loan programs has kept technical and vocational school operators from opening schools in impoverished areas; (5) many individuals living in impoverished areas have been effectively denied an opportunity to access technical and vocational higher education; and (6) the performance of a technical or vocational institution of higher education can be measured by objective data concerning the outcome from the perspective of the student. SEC. 3. USE OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY IN INSTITUTIONAL ELIGIBILITY FOR GUARANTEED STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM. Section 435(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1085(a)) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraph (2)'' and inserting ``paragraphs (2) and (4)''; (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``An institution'' and inserting ``Except as provided in paragraph (4), an institution''; (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ``(4) Ineligibility based on educational quality index.-- ``(A) Use of index in place of cohort default rate.--A proprietary institution of higher education (as such term is defined in section 481(b)) shall not be subject to ineligibility determinations under paragraph (2), but shall be subject to such determinations on the basis of the educational quality index prescribed under this paragraph. ``(B) Prescription of index.--The Secretary of Education shall by regulation prescribe an educational quality index for the purpose of evaluating the programs of proprietary institutions of higher education. Such index shall be equal to the sum of the following component indexes: ``(i) A placement rate index which shall be based on the percentage of students who are employed in the field for which the institution has trained them. ``(ii) A Pell grant eligibility index equal to (I) the percentage of enrolled students who are eligible for Pell grants, minus (II) the national average percentage of students who are so eligible at all institutions of higher education, divided by (III) four. ``(iii) An index based on the institution's cohort default rate (as determined under subsection (m)). ``(iv) A successful completion index which shall be based on graduation rates (as determined for purposes of section 484(a)(1)(C)), or on certification or licensure rates (if available). ``(C) Contents of regulations.--The regulations prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph (B) shall-- ``(i) define the minimum aggregate score that an proprietary institution of higher education must achieve, as a sum of the 4 indexes established under clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of such subparagraph, in order for the institution to remain eligible to participate in the programs under this part; ``(ii) provide that the weights to be attributed to such 4 indexes for purposes of aggregating such score shall require that, of the maximum possible aggregate score-- ``(I) 37.5 percent shall be attributed to the index described in subparagraph (B)(i); ``(II) 25 percent shall be attributed to subparagraph (B)(ii); ``(III) 25 percent shall be attributed to subparagraph (B)(iii); and ``(IV) 12.5 percent shall be attributed to subparagraph (B)(iv); and ``(iii) establish the procedures for the determination of scores for individual institutions, and for the resolution of disputes concerning such scores.''.

(b) Program Review.--Section 498A(a)(2)(A) of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1099c-1(a)(2)(A)) is amended by inserting before the semicolon the following: ``or, in the case of a proprietary institution of higher education, an educational quality index score that does not equal or exceed the minimum established by the Secretary under section 435(a)(4)(B)(i)''.\",\n",

The Congress finds that-- (1) cohort default rates alone do not indicate the quality of an educational institution; (2) for the purpose of evaluating performance of an institution of higher education, the population which that institution serves should be taken into account; (3) schools whose students are from less affluent backgrounds have more difficulty with cohort default rate standards; (4) use of the cohort default rates as a determinant for participation in Federal student loan programs has kept technical and vocational school operators from opening schools in impoverished areas; (5) many individuals living in impoverished areas have been effectively denied an opportunity to access technical and vocational higher education; and (6) the performance of a technical or vocational institution of higher education can be measured by objective data concerning the outcome from the perspective of the student.

Such index shall be equal to the sum of the following component indexes: ``(i) A placement rate index which shall be based on the percentage of students who are employed in the field for which the institution has trained them. ``(ii) A Pell grant eligibility index equal to (I) the percentage of enrolled students who are eligible for Pell grants, minus (II) the national average percentage of students who are so eligible at all institutions of higher education, divided by (III) four. ``(iii) An index based on the institution's cohort default rate (as determined under subsection (m)). ``(iv) A successful completion index which shall be based on graduation rates (as determined for purposes of section 484(a)(1)(C)), or on certification or licensure rates (if available). ``(C) Contents of regulations.--The regulations prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph (B) shall-- ``(i) define the minimum aggregate score that an proprietary institution of higher education must achieve, as a sum of the 4 indexes established under clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of such subparagraph, in order for the institution to remain eligible to participate in the programs under this part; ``(ii) provide that the weights to be attributed to such 4 indexes for purposes of aggregating such score shall require that, of the maximum possible aggregate score-- ``(I) 37.5 percent shall be attributed to the index described in subparagraph (B)(i); ``(II) 25 percent shall be attributed to subparagraph (B)(ii); ``(III) 25 percent shall be attributed to subparagraph (B)(iii); and ``(IV) 12.5 percent shall be attributed to subparagraph (B)(iv); and ``(iii) establish the procedures for the determination of scores for individual institutions, and for the resolution of disputes concerning such scores.''.
